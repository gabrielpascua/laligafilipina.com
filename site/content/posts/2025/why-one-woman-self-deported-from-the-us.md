description: "At 31, Jill Damatac made the decision to self-deport from the United States, ending 22 years of life as an undocumented migrant. Her journey began at age nine, when her family left the Philippines for the US in search of a better life. But instead of opportunity, they encountered instability, xenophobia, and an immigration system Jill describes as broken."
