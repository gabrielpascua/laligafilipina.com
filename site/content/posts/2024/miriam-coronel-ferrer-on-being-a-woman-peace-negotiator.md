description: "Listen to this episode from The Howie Severino Podcast on Spotify. Then-President Noynoy Aquino took a risk when appointing a woman as peace negotiator with the male-dominated MILF.  But the decision bore fruit with the historic “comprehensive agreement” with the MILF in 2014.   Miriam Coronel-Ferrer talks about the cultural biases women face around the world, including the Philippines despite its high global rankings in gender equality indexes."
