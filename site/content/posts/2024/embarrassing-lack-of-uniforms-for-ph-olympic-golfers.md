description: "A video posted by the mother of golfer Dottie Ardina has gone viral as Team Philippines, which has one of the smaller delegation in these Games, did not look properly dressed for action at Le Golf National for the Paris Olympics 2024. In a joint statement, the National Golf Association of the Philippines and the Philippine Olympic Committee said the reason why Ardina and fellow golfer Bianca Pagdanganan have “dressed down” is because their uniforms failed to clear customs in Paris."
