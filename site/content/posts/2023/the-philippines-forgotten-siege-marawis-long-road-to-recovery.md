description: In May 2017, government forces began a fierce siege of Marawi, a provincial capital on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. It took five months of heavy shelling and street-by-street fighting to root out Maute rebels linked to so-called Islamic State, at the cost of more than 1,000 lives and of displacing some 360,000 people.
