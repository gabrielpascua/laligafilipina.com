description: "Maura came to St. Louis from the Philippines to be put on display at the 1904 World’s Fair. She soon fell ill and died, and records suggest a world-renowned anthropologist from the Smithsonian Institution’s United States National Museum took part of her brain. Few people would know what happened to her for more than a century."
