description: "A mother of three has fought 10 years to legally terminate her marriage in the Philippines where divorce is still illegal and an annulment can take years in courts. Stella Sibonga wanted to end a marriage she was forced into after she became pregnant. But in the Catholic-majority country, the government can appeal the courtâ€™s decision to grant annulment, creating endless cycles of trials and fees."
