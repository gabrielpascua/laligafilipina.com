description: A Philippine tanker is still leaking oil, weeks after the vessel sank off the coast of Mindoro on February 28, 2023. A fishing ban remains in place indefinitely, keeping thousands of Filipino fishermen ashore, cleaning up the oil spill for an income which is a fraction of what they used to make. With no other jobs to turn to, many now worry about how much longer they can survive on such a low wage.
